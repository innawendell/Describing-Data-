    "## Intro to word2vec\n",
    "\n",
    "The most common unsupervised neural network approach for NLP is word2vec, a shallow neural network model for converting words to vectors using distributed representation: Each word is represented by many neurons, and each neuron is involved in representing many words.  At the highest level of abstraction, word2vec assigns a vector of random values to each word.  For a word W, it looks at the words that are near W in the sentence, and shifts the values in the word vectors such that the vectors for words near that W are closer to the W vector, and vectors for words not near W are farther away from the W vector.  With a large enough corpus, this will eventually result in words that often appear together having vectors that are near one another, and words that rarely or never appear together having vectors that are far away from each other.  Then, using the vectors, similarity scores can be computed for each pair of words by taking the cosine of the vectors.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This may sound quite similar to the Latent Semantic Analysis approach you just learned.  The conceptual difference is that LSA creates vector representations of sentences based on the words in them, while word2vec creates representations of individual words, based on the words around them."

    "Word2vec is useful for any time when computers need to parse requests written by humans. The problem with human communication is that there are so many different ways to communicate the same concept. It's easy for us, as humans, to know that \"the silverware\" and \"the utensils\" can refer to the same thing. Computers can't do that unless we teach them, and this can be a real chokepoint for human/computer interactions. If you've ever played a text adventure game (think _Colossal Cave Adventure_ or _Zork_), you may have encountered the following scenario:"

    "And your brain explodes from frustration. A text adventure game that incorporates a properly trained word2vec model would have vectors for \"pick up\", \"lift\", and \"take\" that are close to the vector for \"grab\" and therefore could accept those other verbs as synonyms so you could move ahead faster. In more practical applications, word2vec and other similar algorithms are what help a search engine return the best results for your query and not just the ones that contain the exact words you used. In fact, search is a better example, because not only does the search engine need to understand your request, it also needs to match it to web pages that were _also written by humans_ and therefore _also use idiosyncratic language_.\n",
    "\n",
    "Humans, man.  \n",
    "\n",
    "So how does it work?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Generating vectors: Multiple algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "In considering the relationship between a word and its surrounding words, word2vec has two options that are the inverse of one another:\n",
    "\n",
    " * _Continuous Bag of Words_ (CBOW): the identity of a word is predicted using the words near it in a sentence.\n",
    " * _Skip-gram_: The identities of words are predicted from the word they surround. Skip-gram seems to work better for larger corpuses.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the sentence \"Terry Gilliam is a better comedian than a director\", if we focus on the word \"comedian\" then CBOW will try to predict \"comedian\" using \"is\", \"a\", \"better\", \"than\", \"a\", and \"director\".  Skip-gram will try to predict \"is\", \"a\", \"better\", \"than\", \"a\", and \"director\" using the word \"comedian\". In practice, for CBOW the vector for \"comedian\" will be pulled closer to the other words, while for skip-gram the vectors for the other words will be pulled closer to \"comedian\".  \n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to moving the vectors for nearby words closer together, each time a word is processed some vectors are moved farther away. Word2vec has two approaches to \"pushing\" vectors apart:\n",
    " \n",
    " * _Negative sampling_: Like it says on the tin, each time a word is pulled toward some neighbors, the vectors for a randomly chosen small set of other words are pushed away.\n",
    " * _Hierarchical softmax_: Every neighboring word is pulled closer or farther from a subset of words chosen based on a tree of probabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is similarity? Word2vec strengths and weaknesses\n",
    "\n",
    "Keep in mind that word2vec operates on the assumption that frequent proximity indicates similarity, but words can be \"similar\" in various ways. They may be conceptually similar (\"royal\", \"king\", and \"throne\"), but they may also be functionally similar (\"tremendous\" and \"negligible\" are both common modifiers of \"size\"). Here is a more detailed exploration, [with examples](https://quomodocumque.wordpress.com/2016/01/15/messing-around-with-word2vec/), of what \"similarity\" means in word2vec.\n",
    "\n",
    "One cool thing about word2vec is that it can identify similarities between words _that never occur near one another in the corpus_. For example, consider these sentences:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"The dog played with an elastic ball.\"\n",
    "\"Babies prefer the ball that is bouncy.\"\n",
    "\"I wanted to find a ball that's elastic.\"\n",
    "\"Tracy threw a bouncy ball.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Elastic\" and \"bouncy\" are similar in meaning in the text but don't appear in the same sentence. However, both appear near \"ball\". In the process of nudging the vectors around so that \"elastic\" and \"bouncy\" are both near the vector for \"ball\", the words also become nearer to one another and their similarity can be detected.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a while after it was introduced, [no one was really sure why word2vec worked as well as it did](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1402.3722v1.pdf) (see last paragraph of the linked paper). A few years later, some additional math was developed to explain word2vec and similar models. If you are comfortable with both math and \"academese\", have a lot of time on your hands, and want to take a deep dive into the inner workings of word2vec, [check out this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1502.03520v7.pdf) from 2016.  \n",
    "\n",
    "One of the draws of word2vec when it first came out was that the vectors could be used to convert analogies (\"king\" is to \"queen\" as \"man\" is to \"woman\", for example) into mathematical expressions (\"king\" + \"woman\" - \"man\" = ?) and solve for the missing element (\"queen\"). This is kinda nifty.\n",
    "\n",
    "A drawback of word2vec is that it works best with a corpus that is at least several billion words long. Even though the word2vec algorithm is speedy, this is a a lot of data and takes a long time! Our example dataset is only two million words long, which allows us to run it in the notebook without overwhelming the kernel, but probably won't give great results.  Still, let's try it!\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few word2vec implementations in Python, but the general consensus is the easiest one to us is in [gensim](https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/models/word2vec.html). Now is a good time to `pip install gensim` if you don't have it yet."
